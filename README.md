# Open Banking 2.0

Note: this is currently only a "placeholder" for a standards proposal along the lines of the following picture:

This is essentially an Operating System, albeit a dedicated one.

The goal is also to *eventually* make banks' own services like online banking, use the same API.

## Is Open Banking 2.0 "Revolutionary"?

Not all, loose coupling is firmly established since _decades_ back.
More recently, Cloud Services and messaging systems like Kafka,
proved that networked interfaces nowadays represent a viable alternative to native mode APIs.

The only "novelty" is standardizing a set of core methods and an associated security solution.

## Playing in the "Sandbox"

Unlike most current Open Banking API concepts, Open Banking 2.0 permits
testing application-specific APIs using _public sandboxes_.
No need to build specific test banks!
